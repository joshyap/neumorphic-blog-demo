                <h3>What is <strong>FIRE</strong>?</h3>
                <p>"FIRE" is an acronymn for "financial independence retire early". It is a relatively young movement that has risen to popularity as individuals have begun to place higher value on their <em>time</em> and <u>freedom</u>, rather than on <b>material goods</b>.</p>

                <h3>Getting started</h3>
                <p>The idea of retiring in your 40s, 30s, or even 20s may sound ridiculous, but there is increasing precedent. There are many ways for you to achieve financial freedom. Read this post for some tips to get started off on the right foot.</p>

                <h3>Common FIRE misconceptions</h3>
                <p>The biggest gripe I hear about FIRE is that people don't want to forgo life in the present for a better future. I would argue that FIRE can help everyone in both the current and future though. In my mind, FIRE is more about maximizing the things and activities that bring you true joy and cutting out the excess waste elsewhere.</p>

                <h3>Sidehustles</h3>
                <p>The easiest way to achieve FIRE status is to have a high-paying salary while saving aggressively. What if you cannot substantially increase your income for some reason though? Developing additional income streams is a great way to supplement your existing income.</p>

                <h3>ETFs 101</h3>
                <p>Exchange traded funds, or ETFs, are a staple in nearly every FIRE proponents toolkit. They are essentially baskets of stocks that let you own slices or percentages of stocks instead of buying stock in individual companies. This allows you to very easily diversify your portfolio and garner consistent returns. </p>

                <h3>Differents paths to FIRE status</h3>
                <p>Ever heard of LeanFire, FatFIRE, Barista FIRE? It turns out that there is no once-size-fits-all FIRE benchmark. Everyone can reach FIRE at different points depending on individual risk tolerance, lifestyle choices, and thoughts on "retirement".</p>
